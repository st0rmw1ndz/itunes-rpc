# iTunes RPC

Shows the current track in iTunes on Discord. Best suited for tracks that have proper metadata.

> **NOTE**
> This is a major work-in-progress. Expect bugs and changes.

## What works?

- Executing the program and reading data from iTunes
- Uploading the album artwork to Imgur
- Displaying that data on Discord

## What needs to work?

- More uploader support, and use a proper uploader abstract class system
- Configuration options, such as the image to use when idling, and the idling string
- Command line interface to provide options as well
