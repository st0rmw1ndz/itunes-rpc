Discord Rich Presence for iTunes.

This is best suited for tracks that have proper metadata.

## What Works

- Executing the program and reading data from iTunes.
- Uploading the album artwork to a variety of uploaders (Catbox, Imgur, OwO), with more coming eventually.
- Displaying the data on Discord.

## What Needs Work

- Configuration options, such as the image to use when idling, and the idling string.
- Command line interface to provide options as well (this has been semi-done, but it's not great).

This shows a button to view the song on Last.fm, if it exists. However, it does not scrobble your music. If you'd like to have this functionality, I'd recommend the **Last.fm Desktop Scrobbler**. See [here](https://www.last.fm/about/trackmymusic) for more information.
